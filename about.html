            Hello, my name is Shane Brown and I am studying Computer Science at Texas A&M. I grew up in Katy, TX and I am currently a senior. 
                 I am an outgoing and active person and I love to learn new things. In my free time,
                 I enjoy playing basketball (or any sports really), going to the gym, and hanging out with friends and family.
                 I also love mystery, challenges, and mind puzzles. <br> <br>
                 Computer Science has been something I have been interested in since high school. I took my first Computer Science course my sophomore year by mistake (only elective I could take
                 aside from child development) and it ended up being one of the best experiences and ultimately made me pursue Computer Science. I enjoy the instant satisfaction
                 when my code works and when I successfully make a project. I also enjoy the instant feedback coding provides when something is not right (I like problem-solving).
                 <br> <br>
                 I would like to pursue more software related career paths as I have a passion for programming. I am very dedicated with my work and passionate. 
                 Once I start a project I love to see it all the way through. Over the years I have grown to love Computer Science even more and 
                 I believe I could easily adapt and provide very beneficial work to
                 a company. I would like to make a difference in the world with the work I do. Life is too short to not enjoy every second and to not challenge yourself. <br><br>
