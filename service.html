        Being from Katy, TX (right outside Houston) Harvey hit the area hard. During Hurricane Harvey, I was not impacted as most of my friends and family were, and I am very thankful. However, instead of using the time off of school to sit around, I wanted to help others
        who were impacted by the Hurricane. I went to go volunteer at my local High School, which was being used as a local shelter. I served food, gave out clothes, and made sure everyone had something to sleep on.
        In addition, I offered my help towards my friends with their family and houses that were impacted. This included tearing down and replacing the walls, flooring, and moving furniture to clean up the house.
        <br><br> I am still looking in the future for more opportunities to help others in their time of need. I  look forward to helping others whether it be something big or small. <br><br>
